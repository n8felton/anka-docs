Anka is a suite of software for creating and managing macOS VMs to run on top of Apple hardware and macOS. It's built on top of the native [Apple Hypervisor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor) technology for maximum performance. It enables the creation of or integration with existing container based DevOps workflows. Unlike existing macOS virtualization solutions, Anka lets the macOS operating system manage virtual machines in the same manner as other native macOS applications.
