## Using Anka

There are many ways in which our customers utilize the Anka Virtualization software and the Anka Build Cloud to achieve on-demand/ephemeral or long-running single-use macOS VMs for iOS and native app building and testing. Anka enables a docker-like experience for teams to create and store project specific VM templates and tags; including start, stop, clone, suspend, modify cpu and ram for, and execution of commands inside of the VMs.

Below are two of the most popular examples of how our customers set up Anka.
