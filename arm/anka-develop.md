## What is Anka Develop?

Anka Develop is a free, but limited, version of our Anka Virtualization software.

## How does it differ from Anka Build and Flow?

Anka Develop is currently restricted to running a single VM at a time. It also does not include VM suspension, tagging, or use of the registry CLI commands. Finally, it will only function on Macbook, Macbook Pro, and Macbook Air hardware.

## How to install Anka Develop?

You can follow the normal [Installing Anka Virtualization package]({{< archRelRef "Getting Started/installing-the-anka-virtualization-package.md" >}}) guide. If you're on laptop hardware, the license will be activated by default.
