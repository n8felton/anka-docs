description: How to upgrade the Anka Virtualization package
---

## Upgrading macOS VM inside Anka VM
> Don't use the System Preference installer to update macOS inside Anka VM. Use the `softwareupdate -Ri` command line tool to upgrade macOS inside Anka VM. Stop the VM and then restart it.


> We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); minor and major version increases can have significant changes.

## Upgrade Procedure (without Anka Build Cloud Controller & Registry)

1) Install the new anka pkg. Follow the [install instructions]({{< relref "docs/Getting Started/installing-the-anka-virtualization-package.md" >}})

2) Upgrade the guest addons inside the VM templates with `anka start --update`. Check the upgrade notes to see if this step is necessary.

## Upgrade Procedure (with Anka Build Cloud Controller & Registry)

When upgrading the entire Anka Build infrastructure (Controller/Registry and Nodes), execute the steps in the following sequence:

1) Wait for all CI/CD jobs to finish. Run `sudo ankacluster disjoin` on your nodes.

2) Install the new anka pkg. Follow the [install instructions]({{< ref "docs/Getting Started/installing-the-anka-virtualization-package.md" >}}).

3) Upgrade the guest addons inside the VM templates with `anka start --update`.

4) Push the newly upgraded VM templates to registry with `anka registry push {vmNameOrUUID} --tag <tag>`.

5) Go to the Controller & Registry server and [upgrade to the latest version]({{< ref "docs/Anka Build Cloud/upgrading.md" >}}).

6) On the nodes, run `sudo ankacluster join http://{controller address}`.
