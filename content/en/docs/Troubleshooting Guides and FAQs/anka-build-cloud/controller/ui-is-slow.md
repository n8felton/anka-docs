## Scenario

Loading the UI seems to be very slow. Node status, CPU, etc, all seem to be delayed.

## Common reasons

1. Lots of VMS and Nodes

## Solution

Increase the space quota from the default 2GB: [https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/maintenance.md#space-quota](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/maintenance.md#space-quota)
