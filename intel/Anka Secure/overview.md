## What is Anka Secure?
Anka Secure solution is built on top of Anka macOS virtualization engine with features to create secure VMs and manage and distribute to the users. Anka VMs by default are intended to provide reproducible, stable, controllable, shareable environment for different tasks: build, test, debug etc.  

VM isolation enables multiple environments simultaneously on the same host.  

Processes running inside isolated Anka VMs can communicate with the outside world, including host via network interfaces, shared folders, pasteboard, and other mechanisms. However, there are use cases where there is a need to disallow any communication between processes running inside Anka VMs and the outside world and/or the host.

Some of the common examples are :  

1. Protecting privileged user access to sensitive data on a single device - Technical support accessing customer systems/data from their workstations, developers accessing and working with corporate developer/application certificates on their workstations.  

2. Increasing productivity of superusers who use macOS workstations by freeing security restrictions which impact their ability to innovate, without compromising enterprise security - iOS developers working/researching with beta versions of libraries, Xcode, third party libraries downloaded from the internet.  

3. Increasing productivity of superusers who use macOS workstations by freeing security restrictions which impact their ability to innovate, without compromising enterprise security - iOS developers working/researching with beta versions of libraries, Xcode, third party libraries downloaded from the internet.  

4. Malware and other sensitive analysis and testing tasks for macOS Anka Secure protects the Anka VM environment from unsolicited use, modifications and leakage of critical resources by controlling access and actions on these machines with a VM Policy.

***Note*** In order to avoid risks of data stealing and modifications by unauthorized users, all information stored on disk images is also encrypted on the fly.
